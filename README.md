# Ronn-NG Homebrew Tap

This repo is a "Tap" for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) that contains formula
definitions for installing [Ronn-NG](https://github.com/apjanke/ronn-ng).

The ironic thing is that the "ronn-ng-prerelease" formula may lag behind the main "ronn-ng" formula, because I update the "-prerelease" formula when making preleases, but when the golden "real" release comes out, I don't bother updating the prerelease formula, because at that point there's no newer prerelease; that won't happen until it gets close to time for the next real release.
